# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 16: October 02, 2019 


**Today's Progress**: Worked on DataQuest's Step 1-Course 2. Finished 'Cleaning and Preparing Data in Python' and 'Python Data Analysis Basics' missions. 

**Thoughts:** Reviewing some basics of Python. However, the great part about DQ is that it allows me to see how uesful simple lists or dictionaries can be while working with data. I also uploaded my first Guided Project on Github using Git Bash terminal.
